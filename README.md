# FEP PhD thesis layout 2025

A thesis model for the FEP PhD thesis. It's an attempt to adapt the [FCUP thesis layout 2024](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/fcup-thesis-layout-2024/gpbvtwzckzgm), available at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), to the [FEP rules for PhD thesis](https://sigarra.up.pt/fep/pt/conteudos_geral.ver?pct_pag_id=1009493&pct_parametros=pv_unidade=7&pct_grupo=28581#28581).

The main modifications are described in the [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).

In the Chapters folders, you can find a quick overview of how to use the model and some useful commands/tips for working within this framework.

## Requisites and Compiling

1. Edit the MS Word templates for the [covers](<.fep/FEP Capa doutoramento.docx>) (front and back) and the [title page](<.fep/Cover sheet.docx>) (in *portuguese*, *capas* e *folha de rosto*).
2. Export the covers as [Front/covers.pdf](Front/covers.pdf) and the title page as [Front/title.pdf](Front/title.pdf).
3. Edit the root [vars.tex](vars.tex) file and provide the same info as in the cover and title page when appropriate.
4. Review and, eventually, edit [preamble.tex](preamble.tex) file. Don't mess with it if you don't know what to do.
5. Edit root [precontent.tex](precontent.tex) file.
6. If you want to ensure that all of your labels are being used, check the *Python* script [scripts/check_references.py](scripts/check_references.py) for a way to verify it.
7. And, now, edit at will!

**_The stock file *main.pdf*, shipped with the [releases](https://github.com/fbrustolin/FEP_phd_thesis_layout_2025/releases/), shows the result of the compilation in the development environment._**

### Compiling tool

* Requires LuaLaTeX.
* Developed with Visual Studio Code with Latex Workshop recipe "latexmk (lualatex)" Â (`latexmk -lualatex`).
* Compiles in Overleaf, but the free compilation time may not be enough.

### Inkscape integration

In the pre-compiled PDF, you can see the use of the SVG package. This package uses Inkscape to compile SVGs into PDFs. Therefore, if you want to use this package, you must have Inkscape discoverable by the system. 

Inkscape's install folder must be in the `$PATH$` environment variable on Windows.
